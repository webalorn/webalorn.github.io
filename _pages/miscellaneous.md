## Hobbies

### TTRPG

I am a big enjoyer and a GM of TTRPGs (tabletop role-playing games), and put some contents about it online on [my ttrpg blog: yalsicorjdr](https://yalsicorjdr.webalorn.com/) (in French). Feel free to reach at *yalsicor.the.kind &lt;at&gt; &lt;gmail&gt;* for any ttrpg-related discussion!

### Books

If you want recommendations:

- Tchaikovsky (*Children of Time* and *Dogs of War* in particular)
- Katherine Arden (*Winternight Trilogy*, starting with *The Bear and the Nightingale*).
