Greetings, I am Théophane Vallaeys (or *webalorn* on the internet), a soon-to-be French PhD student at [Meta (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/research/) in Paris and at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/), under the supervision of [Jakob Verbeek](https://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/verbeek/) and [Matthieu Cord](https://cord.isir.upmc.fr/).

My PhD project revolves around generative image models seen as world models, and the applications of such models to improve synthetic training.

## My background and history

I studied at the [École normale supérieure (ENS)](https://www.ens.psl.eu/) in Paris, where I obtained my Licence (bachelor degree) as well as my Master degree from the [IASD Master program](https://www.masteriasd.eu/), focusing on artificial intelligence. Before that, I took part into many computer science competitions, including the Internation Olympiads in Informatics (IOI).
